    <description>This mod requires REPENTOGON. Press the tilde key to open the new debug console and menu. There's a new Shenanigans option that will let you view/modify stats and achievements.

The data here is presented very simply. Look [url=https://repentogon.com/enums/EventCounter.html]here[/url] to find out more information about each of the stats. Look [url=https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Achievements]here[/url] to find out more information about each of the achievements.

If anything doesn't seem to be saving, try starting and exiting a new run.

You can also import/export all your data. When you set a field, it can trigger another field. Make sure to look over your data after performing a bulk import. If something seems wrong, a second import may fix it.

The import JSON uses this format for modded achievements: &quot;M-{achievementName}{modId}&quot;. If you remove &quot;M-&quot;, this is the same format you'll find in Repentogon's achievementsX.json files which are located here: C:\Users\username\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Repentance\Repentogon

Modded achievements are now supported.

This is a companion mod to:
