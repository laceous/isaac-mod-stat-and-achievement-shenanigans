    <description>This mod requires REPENTOGON. Press the tilde key to open the new debug console and menu. There's a new Shenanigans option that will let you view/modify stats and achievements.

The data here is presented very simply. Look [url=https://repentogon.com/enums/EventCounter.html]here[/url] to find out more information about each of the stats. Look [url=https://bindingofisaacrebirth.wiki.gg/wiki/Achievements]here[/url] to find out more information about each of the achievements.

If anything doesn't seem to be saving, try starting and exiting a new run.

You can also import/export all your data. When you set a field, it can trigger another field. Make sure to look over your data after performing a bulk import. If something seems wrong, a second import may fix it.

The import JSON uses this format for modded achievements: &quot;M-{achievementName}{modId}&quot;. If you remove &quot;M-&quot;, this is the same format you'll find in Repentogon's achievementsX.json files which are located here: C:\Users\username\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Repentance+\Repentogon

Modded achievements are now supported.

This is a companion mod to:

Update: If you're starting from a new save file and use the alt+f2 trick from the stats menu (which imports achievements from steam), it doesn't fill in your item/ending/bestiary collections. There's a new Misc tab that will help fill those out. Fine control over most of these numbers isn't currently available. Secrets can be controlled via the Achievements tab. Online can be controlled by going to the Stats tab and searching for online_sin.</description>
